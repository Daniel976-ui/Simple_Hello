Simple_Hello is a simple program that greats you when you open the terminal

To make it start up on terminal launch go into your .bashrc file it is found in the home directory and add the following text at the bottom "simple_Hello"

If you wish to change the start up name you can run simple_hello -d (your desired name)

To install run 
"git clone https://github.com/Daniel976-ui/Simple_Hello.git"
Then run the .deb file in it

Thanks
